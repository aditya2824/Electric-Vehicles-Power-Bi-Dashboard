# ‚ö° Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Analytics Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive and interactive **Power BI Dashboard** that analyzes and visualizes the adoption trends of **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** using real-world data from Washington State.

The goal is to uncover critical insights into the growing EV market, enabling stakeholders such as government agencies, city planners, electric utility providers, and auto manufacturers to make **data-driven decisions** regarding **EV infrastructure development**, **policy planning**, and **sustainable transportation strategies**.

---

## üéØ Key Objectives

- Identify **patterns in EV adoption** over time.
- Compare **EV make and model popularity**.
- Analyze **EV range improvements and pricing trends**.
- Visualize **regional concentration** of EVs across cities and counties.
- Examine **electric utility coverage** and **CAFV policy eligibility**.
- Support **future planning** for charging infrastructure and clean energy incentives.
